Intro
=====

The Base tier extends the Core tier to provide more general but still often used functionality, as well as sane defaults. This extended functionality helps the developer to focus on building a web application, and not an application framework.

It forms the basis on which the [Backend-PHP Framework](https://github.com/backend/Backend-PHP) is built.

Install
=======

It can be installed from source.

Requirements
============

Base uses [Backend-PHP Interfaces](https://github.com/backend/Backend-PHP-Interfaces) and [Backend-PHP Core](https://github.com/backend/Backend-PHP-Core), and as this packages uses namespaces, PHP 5.3 is required.
